## 🚀 Basic Details

### 🏷️ Team Name:
**Code Croczzz**

### 👥 Team Members:
- **Team Lead:** Joseph Shibu – Sahrdaya College of Engineering & Technology  
- *(Add more members if needed)*

### 💡 Project Description:
A fun and interactive hand-controlled puzzle game where you solve a jigsaw puzzle using your bare fingers and camera — with invisible pieces! Why? Because it's hauntingly useless!

---

## 🤯 The Problem (That Doesn’t Exist)
Ever had the urge to solve a jigsaw puzzle with your hands *virtually*, where you can't see the pieces but know they exist? No? Exactly.

---

## 🤷 The Solution (That Nobody Asked For)
We made a 2x2 ghost puzzle where pieces are invisible (but outlined), and once placed correctly — they magically appear! Controlled by your fingers via your webcam. Useless, but satisfying.
